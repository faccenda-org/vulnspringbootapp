name: Dependency Review

# Prerequisites:
# - Dependency graph must be enabled in repository settings
# - GitHub Advanced Security (GHAS) must be enabled for private repositories
#   Note: GHAS is FREE for public repositories, but requires a paid plan (Team/Enterprise + security add-ons) for private repos
#   If you don't have GHAS enabled, you can:
#   1. Make the repository public (GHAS is free for public repos)
#   2. Purchase GHAS for your organization (requires GitHub Team/Enterprise plan)
#   3. Disable this workflow and use alternative dependency scanning tools
# See: https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/dependabot/dependabot-alerts/configuring-dependabot-alerts
